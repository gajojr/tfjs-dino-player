DDQN (Double Deep Q-Network) is a variation of the Deep Q-Network algorithm, which was developed to solve the problem of overestimation of Q-values in the Q-learning algorithm.

In DDQN, two deep neural networks, the online network and the target network, are used to learn the Q-values of the actions in the environment. The online network is updated at every iteration of the training process, while the target network is updated less frequently. The target network is used to generate the Q-values for the next state and the online network is used to select the action with the highest Q-value for the current state.

DDQN uses a technique called experience replay to store the agent's experiences in the environment. At each time step, the agent observes the current state, selects an action, and receives a reward. The experience is then stored in a replay buffer. During training, batches of experiences are randomly sampled from the replay buffer and used to update the online network.

One of the key benefits of using experience replay is that it reduces the correlation between consecutive samples, which can help to stabilize the learning process.

The training process of DDQN involves the following steps:

Initialize the replay buffer with a fixed capacity.
Initialize the online and target networks with random weights.
Observe the current state of the environment.
With a certain probability, select a random action, otherwise, select the action with the highest Q-value predicted by the online network.
Execute the selected action and observe the reward and the next state.
Store the experience in the replay buffer.
Sample a batch of experiences from the replay buffer.
Preprocess the state of each experience by converting it to grayscale, cropping it, and stacking it with the previous three frames to provide better context about the state of the environment.
Use the online network to predict the Q-values for the current state and the target network to predict the Q-values for the next state.
Calculate the temporal difference error between the predicted Q-value and the actual reward plus the discounted maximum Q-value of the next state.
Use backpropagation to update the weights of the online network to minimize the temporal difference error.
Update the target network with the weights of the online network every N iterations.
The use of two networks and experience replay helps to reduce overestimation of Q-values and make the training process more stable. DDQN has been shown to achieve better performance than DQN on a variety of reinforcement learning tasks.
