1. Define a function called preprocessGameData that preprocesses the data from the game environment to create tensors that will be fed to the neural network.

2. Define a function called updateTargetModel that updates the weights of the target model with the weights of the online model.

3. Define a function called trainDinoModel that implements the training loop for the model.

4. Inside the trainDinoModel function, initialize epsilon and episodeReward variables to 0.

5. For each episode, reset the game environment and initialize the state variable.

6. In the while loop, select an action using the selectAction function.

7. Perform the selected action using the performAction function.

8. Obtain the next state of the game environment and compute the reward and done flags.

9. Add the state, action, reward, next state, and done to the memory buffer.

10. If the memory buffer has enough experiences, sample experiences from it and optimize the online model using the optimizeModel function.

11. Decay the exploration rate epsilon.

12. Update the target model weights periodically.

13. Log the results for each episode and reset the episode reward variable.

14. Define a function called optimizeModel that optimizes the online model using a batch of experiences.

15. Inside the optimizeModel function, compute the online and target model Q-values and the target Q-value.

16. Compute the loss and update the online model.

17. Define a function called createModel that creates a new neural network model.

18. Define a function called launchBrowser that launches a puppeteer browser and navigates to the game environment.

19. Define a function called setupModelTraining that sets up the training process.

20. Inside the setupModelTraining function, load the saved model or create a new one if it does not exist.

21. Load the target model from the same file location as the main model.

22. Define the hyperparameters for the training process.

23. Define a function called saveAndExit that saves the models before exiting.

24. Handle the SIGINT signal (Ctrl + C) using readline.

25. Handle uncaught exceptions.

26. Train the model using the trainDinoModel function.

27. Save the models to disk storage in separate folders.

The provided code implements all of these steps to train a DDQN model to play the dinosaur game.
