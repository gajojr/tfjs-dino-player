1. Pass the --play parameter to execute playTheGame() function.
2. Launch a headless browser instance with muted audio and go to the localhost.
3. Wait for the Runner instance to be defined.
4. Create a proxy object using the loaded page with functions jump(), duck(), stand(), speed(), obstacles(), restart(), and crashed().
5. Load the existing saved target model using tf.loadLayersModel() (from a folder with model.json and .bin files).
6. Compile the loaded model, as we cannot fit or evaluate the model before it is compiled:
	- Use the adam optimizer.
	- Use the mean squared error loss function.
7. Run gameLoopPlay():
	- Restart the proxy object.
	- Jump to start the game.
	- Get the state by preprocessing the game data.
	- Run an endless while loop:
		1. Get the input tensor from the current state.
		2. Choose the best action by predicting Q-values using the model.
		3. Perform the action using the proxy object.
		4. Execute the next frame using tf.nextFrame().
		5. Get the new state by preprocessing the updated game data.
		5. Dispose of the tensors used in the previous step.
		6. If the agent crashed:
			- Restart the proxy object.
			- Get the new state by preprocessing the updated game data.

Note: Updated gameLoopPlay() function is better than the previous one because it disposes of the used tensors at the end of each loop iteration, thus freeing up memory. This can prevent potential memory leaks and improve the overall performance of the code.
