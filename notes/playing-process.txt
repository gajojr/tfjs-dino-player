1. pass --play parameter to execute playTheGame function
2. load browser instance with muted audio and go to localhost
3. wait for Runner instance to be defined
4. create proxy using loaded page with functions jump, duck, stand, speed, obstacles, restart i crashed
5. load existing model using tf.loadLayersModel (folder with json and .bin file)
6. compile model because we cannot fit or evalute model before it's compiled
	- adam optimizer
	- loss mean squared error
7. run gameLoopPlay
	- restart proxy
	- jump to start the game
	- get state by preprocessing
	- run endless while loop:
		- get input tensor from state
		- choose action by prediction
		- perform action
		- exectute next frame
		- get new state
			- if crashed, restart and get state again
